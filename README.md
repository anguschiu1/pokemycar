# Poke My Car, an anonymous car owner notification serivice

Poke My Car is notification service for car owner. By sticking a QR code image on the car windshield, anyone can scan and inform something to the car owner by scanning the QR code on the windshield. 

For example, if a pedestrain find the car is obstructing his way, he can scan the QR code, and send a brief message to car owners to drive the car away.

The app goes into several sections:

1. Car owner notification subscription service
1. QR code label customizer and generator
1. Notification module (thinking it can as simply as using IFTTT to do the notifications)
1. Notification display module

Future features:

1. Associate poke sender to car owner identity (if they wish to)
1. Enable car owner to reply to those who poke them
1. Social network function (e.g. setup e.g. `Meter community` or `Traffic Ticket avoidance radar`)
1. Integrated to social network or IM module
1. Cryptocurrency exchange capability
